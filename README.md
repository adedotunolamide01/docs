# Landing Page

## A Masterschool/Udacity Project

### Description

This project is about creating an interactive web page with focus on  
having classes set to active when inside the viewport. The nav menu  
is also done by Javascript.

This is a landing page project. I learnt how to use javascript with scroll functions
and validation of forms are my key take away in this sections.

### Requirements

A modern browser.

### Contents

index.html, css/styles.css, js/app.js and this README file.

### Credits

Many thanks to endless videos about Javascript on udemy  
, youtube and the MDN Ressources as well as input  
from Masterschool instructors and fellow students :)

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
